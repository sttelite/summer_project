Language Recognition Program
Introduction:
The goal of this program is to accurately identify the language of a given text. Program aims 
to provide reliable language recognition capabilities.
Problem Description:
The problem revolves around recognizing the language of a given text input. The program 
needs to accurately identify the language from a set of possible languages: English, French, 
German, Spanish, Ukrainian and Russian.
Formalization of the Problem:
The problem can be formalized as follows:
Input: A text string written in one of the possible languages.
Output: The identified language of the input text.
Proposed Algorithm:
The language recognition problem can be approached through the following algorithmic 
steps:
a. Letter Recognition: Implement a letter recognition mechanism to identify individual letters 
in the input text.
b. Letter Combination Analysis: Analyze combinations of letters (e.g., digraphs, trigraphs) to 
capture language-specific patterns and characteristics. Create language-specific profiles of 
common letter combinations.
c. Probabilistic Analysis: Using probabilistic methods to 
calculate probability of the input text belonging to each language based on letter 
combinations.
d. Decision Tree: Develop a decision tree algorithm to handle basic exceptions, such as the 
presence of specific letters that uniquely identify a particular language.
Input and Output Format:
Input: The program accepts a text string as input, which can be entered through the console.
Output: The program outputs the identified language of the input text, displayed in the 
console.
Program Interface:
The program interface will be implemented as a console application. The user can input the 
text to be recognized, and the program will display the identified language as the output.
Interactivity:
The program will provide a user-friendly experience by displaying clear instructions and 
prompts to guide the user through the recognition process. Error handling will be 
implemented to handle invalid inputs gracefully
